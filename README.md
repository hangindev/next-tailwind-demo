# Next.js with Tailwind Demo

This demo shows how to use Tailwind (a utility-first CSS framework) in a Next.js project.

It uses Tailwind built-in purge feature to keep generated CSS small and performant. Modify options in `tailwind.config.js` following this [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/).

**Demo:** [https://next-tailwind-demo.vercel.app/](https://next-tailwind-demo.vercel.app/)

## Using in Visual Studio Code

Custom data for VS Code CSS Language Service for Tailwind's @ directives is defined in the `.vscode` folder, thanks to this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61333686/9912194?stw=2). Remove the `.vscode` folder if you don't need it.
